# Breast-Cancer-Predictions

Your work must clearly reflect the preprocessing steps and the outcome for each like handling missing values (if any), outlier detection, data scaling. Feature engineering - feature selection (show multi-collinear features), dimensionality reduction, transformation of skewed data. Model Training - hyper-parameter tuning, cross validation. Model Evaluation - evaluation metrics, confusion matrix, ROC curve analysis and plots. Interpretability - coefficient interpretation, feature importances, model probabilities, variance and bias trade-off, model robustness and evaluation metrics. Your work must include the reasoning for the steps performed under each criteria in the rubrics mentioned below. 

The rubrics criteria is:
